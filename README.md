## Install

Downloads are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/R2NorthstarTools/FlightCore/releases).

**Windows:** Download `FlightCore_X.Y.Z_x64_en-US.msi` and then run the installer by double-clicking the file.

**Linux:** Download `flight-core_X.Y.Z_amd64.AppImage`, put it in a preferred location and make it executable. A Flatpak version is planned for the future.
